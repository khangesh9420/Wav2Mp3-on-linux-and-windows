"for dynamically run file install mp3lame library on linux and Windows"

I have completed the task as per the requirements where it will work on both Windows and Linux.
It will run Only POSIX Function.

On Linux......

In here on LINUX I compiled program  statically and dynamically where if 
in "makfile" 
 "STATIC_LIB =1" // create static file i.e All_wave_static_linux
 "STATIC_LIB = 0"// create dynamic file i.e All_wave_dynamic_linux

step 1 :- make the file using "make" command
          'make'

step 2 :-  Run the program using following commands
          ./exe/All_wave_static_linux audio // for static file
          ./exe/All_wave_dynamic_linux audio // for dynamic

on Windows........Cygwin(32 bit)(library is to add gcc-core, g++, make,from (DEVEL) Package)


In here on Windows I compiled program  statically and dynamically where if 
in "makfile" 
 "STATIC_LIB =1" // create static file i.e All_wave_static_win.exe
 "STATIC_LIB = 0"// create dynamic file i.e All_wave_dynamic_win.exe

step 1 :- make the file using "make" command
          'make'

step 2 :- Run the program using following commands
         ./exe/All_wave_dynamic_win.exe audio // dynamic file on windows
         ./exe/All_wave_static_win.exe audio  //static file on windows
